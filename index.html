        <h3 class="display-4-lana">How do I sign up?</h2>
        <p>
          Go <a href="https://mygs.girlscouts.org/" target="_blank">here</a> and select "Find a Troop." If you search by zipcode, our troop (#47905) will come up. Alternatively, get in touch with us (<a href="mailto:girlscouts47905@gmail.com" target="_blank">girlscouts47905@gmail.com</a>) and one of our troop leaders can get the necessary information and enroll your child.

      <div class="info-box">
        <h3 class="display-4-lana">Who's running it?</h2>
        <p>
          Rachael Carlson is our troop leader and Alana Hanson is the assistant troop leader. We each have two kids at Dawes, including daughters who will be part of the Daisy troop. There are many roles that other adults can take on to help with the troop and we would appreciate any and all interested volunteers!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="info-box">
        <h3 class="display-4-lana">When are the meetings?</h2>
        <p>
          We will have regular meetings in the Dawes gym on the 1st and 3rd Tuesday of every month, from 6-7 pm.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="info-box">
        <h3 class="display-4-lana">Who can join?</h2>
        <p>
          At this time we will be accepting girls at the Daisy level (K and 1st grade) and the Brownie level (2nd and 3rd grade). The total number of girls in the troop will be dependent on how many adult volunteers we have, as there are child-adult ratios we have to maintain.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="info-box">
        <h3 class="display-4-lana">How much does it cost?</h2>
        <p>
          There are three main costs associated with joining the troop:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h6>Membership registration fee</h6>
              <p>An annual membership is $25 for either a girl or an adult who takes part as a volunteer. This goes to Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA).</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h6>Troop fees</h6>
              <p>The troop fees for the 2024-2025 school year will be $40 per girl. This money goes to the troop itself to pay for supplies, including troop badges.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h6>Uniform costs</h6>
              <p>While the uniform will be optional, we strongly encourage all the girls to get one! The total for either a Daisy or Brownie uniform will be around $50.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          Our council (Girl Scouts of Greater Chicago and Northwest Indiana) offers financial assistance for any or all of these expenses! Please see <a href="https://www.girlscoutsgcnwi.org/en/get-involved/join/for-families/financial-assistance.html" target="_blank">their site</a> for more information on this or ask one of the troop leaders. You can make the request on your own or ask a troop leader to do it for you, whichever is more convenient. It is important to us that all girls who want to join the troop are able regardless of ability to pay, so please reach out if you need any help or advice on getting assistance.
